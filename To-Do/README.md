# To-Do List Maker

This is a webpage that allows users to create a To-Do List. Users can add, delete, or mark to-dos as completed. The to-dos are stored in local storage so that the user may return to them if they are not completed.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a more simple and easy to use daily To-Do list for users.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
